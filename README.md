# [Generate an Arstotzkan Papers Please passport - papers.floppa.hair](https://papers.floppa.hair)

One day, I wanted to generate some of my own documents, and searched for a generator, but I couldn't find any, so I set to create my own one. This was done in the most slap in way possible, the code is a mess and it's done in vanilla js with no framework, however, it does work, and afaik it works well, and it generates passports nicely. If you have an issue, like a bug, put it into [Issues](https://github.com/woodendoors7/papersPleaseDocumentGenerator/issues).


This is also kind of a tribute to my super old "Based card generator", which honestly sucked, but I did learn a bit of JS that way, and practically it works in the same principle.
